Yelpcamp is the famous massive full-stack project from Colt Steele's Web Devloper Bootcamp.

It is a campground website where users can register and then add, book and delete campsites while viewing their images,prices and locations on a map along with various other details presented with a beautiful and easy to use UI.

The application also takes care of some security issues like NoSQL injections and Cross-Site scripting.

## Features
* Users can create accounts and add or book campsites based on their price and location preferences.The campsite links are attached with images and their locations can be viewed on the map feature.
* Users can review campgrounds and update or remove them too.
* User profiles show some details of the user (full name, email, phone, join date), their campgrounds, and the option to edit their profile or delete their account.
* Search campgrounds by their names and locations.
* Sort campgrounds by highest rating, most reviewed, lowest price, or highest price.
